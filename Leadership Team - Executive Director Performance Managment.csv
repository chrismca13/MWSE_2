One of Shamars notable strengths is his ability to be understanding and compassionate towards the team members. This creates a positive and supportive work environment, fostering collaboration and motivation among the team. Additionally, his driven nature is evident in his commitment to pushing the organization towards success. He has been tasked with making several difficult decisions over the past few years, and in my opinion, has stepped up and made them, knowing that those decisions were going to make a large impact both to the organization and to the leadership team. He is committed to making the choice he believes is right- whether it's a favorable opinion or not- and that itself is a SKILL. Shamar demonstrates a good understanding of the organization's objectives and works diligently to motivate us all to work towards achieving them. While I may not always agree with Shamar's decisions, I have absolute respect for him as an ED. Any executive Director role has to be extremely stressful, and at times, near impossible. Shamar continuously brings energy and positive encouragement to both the leadership team and the staff. I would like to see Shamar be a bit more transparent in communication, as I do feel at times the leadership team is left in the dark on certain decisions/ problems/issues that we may be facing. However,  I do understand that sometimes that may be a conscious choice- or it may be necessity. I am happy to follow Shamar's lead. "
