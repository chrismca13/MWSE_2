Her ability to set realistic goals has undoubtedly contributed to the overall success and productivity of our department.    Misty deserves recognition for her approachability and willingness to make herself available for questions and guidance. Whenever I seek clarification or advice, she is quick to respond and provides valuable insight. This open line of communication fosters a positive and collaborative atmosphere with my and my team.     While Misty's goal-setting and communication skills are highly effective, there is room for growth in the area of delegation and trust. Often, she assumes a significant portion of the workload, which could potentially hinder the team's overall efficiency. Encouraging delegation of tasks to team members would allow others to contribute their skills and expertise, leading to a more well-rounded and capable team.     Additionally, it would be beneficial for Misty to trust in the abilities of her colleagues a little more.' By fostering trust within the team, she can empower team members to take ownership of their responsibilities, promoting a culture of accountability and professional growth. Trusting others to handle tasks can also provide her with more time to focus on strategic decisions and higher-level responsibilities.    "
