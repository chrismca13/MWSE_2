Misty
consistently
establishes
clear
and
achievable
objectives
for
our
"team,"
which
has
been
instrumental
in
keeping
us
aligned
and
focused
on
our
collective
purpose.
Her
ability
to
set
realistic
goals
has
undoubtedly
contributed
to
the
overall
success
and
productivity
of
our
department.
""
""
""
Misty
deserves
recognition
for
her
approachability
and
willingness
to
make
herself
available
for
questions
and
guidance.
Whenever
I
seek
clarification
or
"advice,"
she
is
quick
to
respond
and
provides
valuable
insight.
This
open
line
of
communication
fosters
a
positive
and
collaborative
atmosphere
with
my
and
my
team.
""
""
""
""
While
Misty's
goal-setting
and
communication
skills
are
highly
"effective,"
there
is
room
for
growth
in
the
area
of
delegation
and
trust.
"Often,"
she
assumes
a
significant
portion
of
the
"workload,"
which
could
potentially
hinder
the
team's
overall
efficiency.
Encouraging
delegation
of
tasks
to
team
members
would
allow
others
to
contribute
their
skills
and
"expertise,"
leading
to
a
more
well-rounded
and
capable
team.
""
""
""
""
"Additionally,"
it
would
be
beneficial
for
Misty
to
trust
in
the
abilities
of
her
colleagues
a
little
more.'
By
fostering
trust
within
the
"team,"
she
can
empower
team
members
to
take
ownership
of
their
"responsibilities,"
promoting
a
culture
of
accountability
and
professional
growth.
Trusting
others
to
handle
tasks
can
also
provide
her
with
more
time
to
focus
on
strategic
decisions
and
higher-level
responsibilities.
""
""
""
""
I
value
Misty's
leadership.
She
is
highly
"organized,"
detail
"oriented,"
and
responds
to
requests
in
a
very
timely
manner.
""
Priorities
seem
not
to
be
set
well
I
believe
Shamar
to
do
a
satisfactory
"job,"
and
deserve
some
major
credit
for
the
type
of
events/changes
that
he
has
had
to
lead
MWSE
through
in
the
past
several
years.
One
of
Shamars
notable
strengths
is
his
ability
to
be
understanding
and
compassionate
towards
the
team
members.
This
creates
a
positive
and
supportive
work
"environment,"
fostering
collaboration
and
motivation
among
the
team.
"Additionally,"
his
driven
nature
is
evident
in
his
commitment
to
pushing
the
organization
towards
success.
He
has
been
tasked
with
making
several
difficult
decisions
over
the
past
few
"years,"
and
in
my
"opinion,"
has
stepped
up
and
made
"them,"
knowing
that
those
decisions
were
going
to
make
a
large
impact
both
to
the
organization
and
to
the
leadership
team.
He
is
committed
to
making
the
choice
he
believes
is
right-
whether
it's
a
favorable
opinion
or
not-
and
that
itself
is
a
SKILL.
Shamar
demonstrates
a
good
understanding
of
the
organization's
objectives
and
works
diligently
to
motivate
us
all
to
work
towards
achieving
them.
While
I
may
not
always
agree
with
Shamar's
"decisions,"
I
have
absolute
respect
for
him
as
an
ED.
Any
executive
Director
role
has
to
be
extremely
"stressful,"
and
at
"times,"
near
impossible.
Shamar
continuously
brings
energy
and
positive
encouragement
to
both
the
leadership
team
and
the
staff.
I
would
like
to
see
Shamar
be
a
bit
more
transparent
in
"communication,"
as
I
do
feel
at
times
the
leadership
team
is
left
in
the
dark
on
certain
decisions/
problems/issues
that
we
may
be
facing.
"However,"
""
I
do
understand
that
sometimes
that
may
be
a
conscious
choice-
or
it
may
be
necessity.
I
am
happy
to
follow
Shamar's
lead.
""
I
value
and
respect
Shamar's
leadership.
He
involves
the
leadership
team
in
"guiding,"
"decision-making,"
and
moving
our
organization
into
the
future.
""
As
Director
of
"MWSE,"
Shamar
has
lead
our
organization
in
a
positive
direction
and
I
believe
his
vision
for
MWSE
will
continue
to
help
us
achieve
successful
goals
in
the
community.
I
have
not
had
many
one
on
one
dealings
with
Shamar
but
what
i
"have,"
he
has
always
shown
strong
leadership
and
i
feel
confident
in
his
ability
to
lead
MWSE
in
the
right
direction.
My
memory
of
Shamar
has
always
been
the
day
he
visited
the
Lenawee
office
and
sat
in
the
resource
room
and
had
conversations
with
customers.
This
was
the
case
a
few
times
he
visited
the
office.
A
man
of
so
many
responsibilities
and
position
and
he
does
not
sit
behind
a
closed
door
rather
he
decides
to
sit
in
the
resource
room
and
talk
with
customers.
""
That
speaks
volumes
of
a
leader
in
my
opinion.
""
I
appreciate
the
Executive
Directors'
eye
to
eye
contact
and
what
feels
like
to
"me,"
expressed
concern
about
how
I
am
"doing,"
when
communicating
with
me.
With
such
a
high
stressed
working
"environment,"
at
"times,"
it
helps
to
be
acknowledged
about
my
well-being.
""
I
don't
interact
with
the
Executive
Director
that
much
on
a
daily
"basis,"
so
I
can't
provide
the
type
of
feedback
required.
""
This
seems
geared
more
toward
personal
"relationships,"
something
I
have
more
with
my
service
center
manager.
""
""
I
believe
that
Shamar
is
a
good
leader
but
it
is
very
clear
that
he
has
not
done
our
job
as
a
customer
facing
person.
""
He
is
very
removed
from
what
the
ACTUAL
work
is
that
we
"do,"
he
is
only
familiar
with
the
administrative
side.
"overall,"
very
satisfied.
he
is
a
great
"""face"""
for
MWSE
Not
necessarily
due
to
the
"director,"
but
there
is
a
general
feeling
here
that
our
location
in
Washtenaw
is
seen
as
the
'trouble'
location.
I
personally
feel
like
this
location
has
been
"ignored,"
"comparatively,"
and
a
facility
upgrade
and
update
on
the
compensation
is
overdue.
I
know
and
see
how
hard
people
work
here
and
we
all
do
well
beyond
our
duties
and
get
recognized
for
"""30%"""
of
what
we
"accomplish,"
which
I
understand
is
kind
of
the
nature
of
the
work.

there's
