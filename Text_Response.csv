Her ability to set realistic goals has undoubtedly contributed to the overall success and productivity of our department.    Misty deserves recognition for her approachability and willingness to make herself available for questions and guidance. Whenever I seek clarification or advice, she is quick to respond and provides valuable insight. This open line of communication fosters a positive and collaborative atmosphere with my and my team.     While Misty's goal-setting and communication skills are highly effective, there is room for growth in the area of delegation and trust. Often, she assumes a significant portion of the workload, which could potentially hinder the team's overall efficiency. Encouraging delegation of tasks to team members would allow others to contribute their skills and expertise, leading to a more well-rounded and capable team.     Additionally, it would be beneficial for Misty to trust in the abilities of her colleagues a little more.' By fostering trust within the team, she can empower team members to take ownership of their responsibilities, promoting a culture of accountability and professional growth. Trusting others to handle tasks can also provide her with more time to focus on strategic decisions and higher-level responsibilities.    "

One of Shamars notable strengths is his ability to be understanding and compassionate towards the team members. This creates a positive and supportive work environment, fostering collaboration and motivation among the team. Additionally, his driven nature is evident in his commitment to pushing the organization towards success. He has been tasked with making several difficult decisions over the past few years, and in my opinion, has stepped up and made them, knowing that those decisions were going to make a large impact both to the organization and to the leadership team. He is committed to making the choice he believes is right- whether it's a favorable opinion or not- and that itself is a SKILL. Shamar demonstrates a good understanding of the organization's objectives and works diligently to motivate us all to work towards achieving them. While I may not always agree with Shamar's decisions, I have absolute respect for him as an ED. Any executive Director role has to be extremely stressful, and at times, near impossible. Shamar continuously brings energy and positive encouragement to both the leadership team and the staff. I would like to see Shamar be a bit more transparent in communication, as I do feel at times the leadership team is left in the dark on certain decisions/ problems/issues that we may be facing. However,  I do understand that sometimes that may be a conscious choice- or it may be necessity. I am happy to follow Shamar's lead. "

This was the case a few times he visited the office. A man of so many responsibilities and position and he does not sit behind a closed door rather he decides to sit in the resource room and talk with customers.  That speaks volumes of a leader in my opinion.

I personally feel like this location has been ignored, comparatively, and a facility upgrade and update on the compensation is overdue. I know and see how hard people work here and we all do well beyond our duties and get recognized for ""30%"" of what we accomplish, which I understand is kind of the nature of the work. There are too few employees in most departments and there's no attempt at any sort of customer system intake process atomization, so the front desk associates are also doing more than they should and still would have more than enough to do without their current phone answering and intake responsibilities being automated. If the automation system could do the basic screenings and intake/document  collecting; career advisors would be free to career advise."
